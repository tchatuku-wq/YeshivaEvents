## 📌 Project Overview

**YeshivaEvents** is an Android mobile application designed to help students easily discover, explore, and manage campus and nearby community events related to Yeshiva University and the surrounding New York City area.

The application centralizes event information that is often scattered across multiple platforms (emails, flyers, websites), providing users with a clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly experience.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Yeshiva University students frequently miss important academic, social, and community events due to:

- Fragmented event information sources  
- Lack of centralized access

There is a need for a single, reliable mobile platform that aggregates events and presents them in an organized and user-friendly way.

- A centralized event feed  
- Intuitive browsing and searching  
- Detailed event views
